# Mojo_community-lib
A community driven mojo lib

# Goal

To make a "standard" library including much of the core functionality expected by a high-level-language, but currently missing from Mojo's standard lib (since mojo is quiet new)

# To-do
- Finnish array (when traits become a thing)
- make list (rd4com in progress)
- make tuple #I'll start work once traits are implemented
- make dictionary #I'll start work once traits are implemented
