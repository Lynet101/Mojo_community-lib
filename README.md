# Mojo_community-lib
> A community driven mojo lib
## Goal
Help grow "standard" library/utilities that might be usefull to users.
## In progress
- Finnish array (when traits become a thing) | Lynet101
- magiclist | rd4com
- Quicksort | Lynet101
# hyperlinks and informations
### [Algorithms/bubble sort](https://github.com/Lynet101/Mojo_community-lib/tree/main/Algorithms/Bubblesort)
### [ish/shims](https://github.com/lsh/shims)
  - [X] bitcasting read/write with endian choice
  - [x] Directory path list files
  - [x] siphash/wyhash
  - [x] file read/write with buffered reader/writer
  - [x] libc: dirent, string, stdio!
  - [ ] more to come
### [magiclist](https://github.com/rd4com/mojo-magiclist)
> untyped list
  - [x] conversions both ways native-types/builtin.object
  - [x] builtin.object type checking
  - [x] typed value based deletion in multi type array
  - [x] index based read write with type switching
### [console-style](https://github.com/rd4com/mojo-console-style-print)
  - [x] ansi color/style
### IO/c-utilies.mojo
naÃ¯ve c interop to improve but it works
- [X] read file
``` var res:String = CUTIL.read_file("test.txt") ```
- [X] Execute command
``` var res:String = CUTIL.exec("ls -lah") ```
## Ideas
- make tuple
- make dictionary
- python -> mojo type conversion
- object arithmetic implementations, like ``__pow__`` and ``__truediv__``
- better python library import
